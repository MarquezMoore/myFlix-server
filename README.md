REST-full API built with Node and Express, provides info on movies.

This project is the second achievement that is part of the CareeFoundry curriculum.

It is a REST-full API created with Node and Express and it uses Passport and JavaScript Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate and authorise a user. The serverr lives on Heroku, whereas the data is found on MongoDB.

Provides all necessary CRUD operations on the Movies and Users document collections.

Documentation is found at: https://movie-api-on-heroku.herokuapp.com/documentation.html

There are two client-side options to choose from in order to use the API, one built using React, and the other built with Angular.

React version can be found here

I deliberately left the design as is in order to show progression in my design skills between older projects (the React one) and newer ones (the Angular one)
